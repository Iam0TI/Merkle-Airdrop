# Merkle-Airdrop
The goal of this  project  is to learn how to implement a smart contract for an airdrop that uses a Merkle tree for whitelisting addresses. I learnt how to generate a Merkle root from a list of eligible addresses, implement a Solidity contract that verifies claims against this Merkle root, and manage the airdrop process.
